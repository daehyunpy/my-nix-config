# Testing Requirements

## Test-Driven Development

MANDATORY workflow:
1. Write test first (RED)
2. Run test - it should FAIL
3. Write minimal implementation (GREEN)
4. Run test - it should PASS
5. Refactor (IMPROVE)
6. Verify coverage (80%+)

## Troubleshooting Test Failures

1. Check test isolation (no shared state between tests)
2. Verify mocks/fixtures are correct
3. Fix implementation, not tests (unless tests are wrong)
4. Use `pytest -v --tb=short` for concise output
